about = Attribute based clustering for vector layers by numeric attributes using hierarchical or k-means algorithms (known and unknown number of clusters supported).
description = Plugin produces clustering for features of vector layer based on unlimited number of attributes using hierarchical or k-means algorithms. Hierarchical algorithm is available in two variations: native realization for known number of clusters and scipy realization for unknown number of clusters. K-means method requieres scipy and known number of clusters. You can define weight for every attribute, if native hierarchical clustering used.

changelog=
    2.0 : update to QGIS 3. Also new clustering method added - scipy hierarchical clustering for unknown number of clusters.
    2.1 : K-Means2 method added. Links to original documentation added. Much more options for scipy algorithms are available.
